# M5Stack-SD-Updater

**M5Stack-SD-Updater is an [Platform.io](https://platformio.org/lib/show/2575/M5Stack-SD-Updater)/[Arduino library](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/m5-stack-sd-updater) for [M5Stack](http://m5stack.com/) to package you apps on a SD card and load them from a menu.**
It is inspired by gamebuino, however it does not use a modified bootloader.

üè≠ PREREQUISITES:
-----------------
**Make sure you have the following libraries:**
  
- M5Stack-SD-Updater (this project): get it from the [Arduino Library Manager](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/m5-stack-sd-updater) or by performing a [manual installation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc5)
- [M5Stack](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Stack) get it from the [Arduino Library Manager](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/m5-stack-sd-updater) or by performing a [manual installation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc5)
- ArduinoJSON: [https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson/](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson/) available in the Arduino Library Manager
- M5StackSAM: [https://github.com/tomsuch/M5StackSAM](https://github.com/tomsuch/M5StackSAM)

**If your version of [M5Stack is (0.1.7)](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Stack/releases/tag/0.1.7) you're done.**

**If your version of M5Stack is 0.1.6 or earlier, install this additional library:**

- QRCode: [https://github.com/ricmoo/qrcode](https://github.com/ricmoo/qrcode) available in the Arduino Library Manager



üç± UNPACKING
------------
Open both sketches from the "examples/M5Stack-SD-Update" menu.

**1) Download the SD-Content folder from the release page and unzip it into the root of the SD Card.** Then put the SD Card into the M5Stack. This zip file comes preloaded with [18 precompiled apps](https://github.com/tobozo/M5Stack-SD-Updater/tree/master/examples/M5Stack-SD-Menu/SD-Apps) and the relative meta information for the menu.


**2) Compile the "M5Stack-SD-Menu.ino" example.** This sketch is the menu app. It must be compiled (sketch / export compiled binary) and saved on the SD Card root directory as "menu.bin" for persistence and flashed on the M5 as well. Note that you won't need to copy it on the SD card if you previously unzipped the SD-Content folder as it's already bundled.


**3) [optional] Merge and compile the "M5Stack-SDLoader-Snippet.ino" example.** It is possible to embed any M5 app by implementing the M5Stack SD Loader Snippet. This sketch can be used as a boilerplate to code an app from scratch.

  For an existing M5 app, find the line:

      #include <M5Stack.h>
      
  And add this:
      
      #include "M5StackUpdater.h"
      
  In your setup() function, find the following statements:

      M5.begin();
      Wire.begin()

  And add this after 'Wire.begin();':

      if(digitalRead(BUTTON_A_PIN) == 0) {
        Serial.println("Will Load menu binary");
        updateFromFS(SD);
        ESP.restart();
      }
      
  Export the compiled binary (Sketch/Export Compiled Binary) and choose one of the above methods to get the app on the M5Stack:

  - Manually copy it to the sd card
  - Existing installations (menu.bin already copied and loaded on the M5Stack): clear the content of the [examples/M5Stack-SD-Menu/data](https://github.com/tobozo/M5Stack-SD-Updater/tree/master/examples/M5Stack-SD-Menu/data) folder, copy the compiled binary there and use the [ESP32 Sketch Data Uploader](https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin) utility (available from the Tools menu in the Arduino IDE).


**4) [optional] Repeat this for all new applications**, jpg images or json meta files to import





üìö USAGE:
---------
When an app is loaded in memory, booting the M5Stack with the BTN_A pushed will flash back the menu.bin into memory. 

When the menu is loaded in memory, it will list all available apps on the sdcard and load them on demand. 

Booting the M5Stack with the BTN_A pushed will power it off.

The [ESP32 Sketch Data Uploader](https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin) can be used to send .bin, jpg, json, mod and mp3 files onto the M5Stack. The menu.bin will take care of dumping them on the SD Card.

Some artwork/credits can be added for every uploaded binary, the menu will scan for these file types:
  
  - .bin compiled application binary
    
  - .jpg image/icon (max 200x100)
    
  - .json file with dimensions descriptions: 
  
  `{"width":128,"height":128,"authorName":"tobozo","projectURL":"http://short.url","credits":"** http://very.very.long.url ~~"}`


  ‚ö†Ô∏è The jpg/json file names must match the bin file name, case matters!
  jpg/json files are optional but must both be set if provided.
  The value for *projectURL* property will be rendered as a QR Code in the info window, it is better provide a short URL there so the resulting QR Code has more error correction.


üö´ LIMITATIONS:
---------------
- SD Library limits file names (including path) to 32 chars, M5StackSAM has a slightly higher limit.
- FAT specifications prevent having more than 512 files on the SD Card, but this menu is limited to 256 Items anyway.
- Long file names will eventually get covered by the jpg image, better stay under 8 chars (not including the extension).


üîò OPTIONAL:
------------
The M5Stack automatically detects and uses the [M5Stack-Faces](https://github.com/m5stack/faces) plugin (gameboy faces only).

The JoyPSP Controls for M5Stack SD Menu necessary code is now disabled in the menu example but the code stays here and can be used as a boilerplate for any other two-wires input device.

This disabled code is optimized for a [4 Wires PSP JoyPad breakout](https://www.google.fr/search?q=psp+joypad+breakout) on Pins 35 and 36, but it shouldn't be a problem to adapt/extend to other analog joystick models.

KNONW ISSUES
------------
*qrcode.h not found*, or *duplicate declarations* errors can occur during compilation of M5Stack-SD-Menu.ino.

Reason: M5Stack recently embedded the `qrcode.h` library into their own core, but the current M5Stack-SD-Menu.ino is using a version of qrcode.h bundled with a more recent version of [M5Stack (0.1.7)](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Stack/releases/tag/0.1.7).
If your version of M5stack library is older, Arduino IDE will probably complain.

Solution 1: comment out one of the two includes in M5Stack-SD-Menu.ino:

`#include "qrcode.h"` ‚Üê use this with M5Stack-Core 0.1.6 and older, comment out the other one

or

`#include "utilities/qrcode.h` ‚Üê use this with M5Stack-Core 0.1.7, comment out the other one

Solution 2: in your library manager, downgrade the M5Stack-SD-Menu to the previous version (0.0.1) until you update M5Stack library

Solution 3: upgrade your M5Stack core version to 0.1.8

Compilation `#pragma` warnings/errors in the Arduino IDE can be solved by setting the debug level to `default` in the Arduino preferences window.
See [#3](https://github.com/tobozo/M5Stack-SD-Updater/issues/3) 

vMicro: currently can't compile at all, see [#5](https://github.com/tobozo/M5Stack-SD-Updater/issues/5). Looking for a solution that works with both vMicro and Arduino IDE.


üõ£ ROADMAP:
----------
Not defined yet, but looking at how fast this [library landed in platform.io](https://platformio.org/lib/show/2575/M5Stack-SD-Updater), there's a possibility it will soon exist in different flavours (i.e. as an ESP-IDF component) or with more [features](https://github.com/m5stack/faces). Contributors welcome!
